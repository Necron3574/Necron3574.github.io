title: Aspire Start Strong+ 2024
description: A blog post about my trip to Seattle to attend the Microsoft Aspire Start Strong+ event.
---

## Prologue??

It all started 3 months ago, when I got a mail from the Aspire team telling me I'm invited to attend the in person Start Strong Plus in Seattle.
Fast forward 3 months of rabidly checking the scheduling website for visa slots, going to Delhi to get a Visa (shoutout to my LT for being super supportive on this) , last minute packing and almost missing flights,  I'm finally at Hyderabad airport - Gate 21 ready to get this started.

![Hyderabad Airport](/assets/images/Hyd_Airport.jpg){: width="40%" .centered}  

We board Vistara (best domestic airline in India imo) which takes us to Delhi. After a 3 quick layover at delhi (We grabbed some McD) we began our main flight.

DEL --> EWR via united airlines

The flight was 16 hours long and quite tedious. I had some issues with the power cords and couldn't charge my device so that was quite a problem. However one of the flight attendants (bless his soul) lent me his powerbank that gave life to my phone. I slept through half the flight and spent the other half eating and chilling. The food served on flight tasted like ~feet~ but the cookies were nice and the excitement of international travel got me through the flight.

## Day 1

16 hours later we finally landed in EWR airport. This was the first time I set foot in the United States so this 3 hour layover included a lot of picture taking.
We went through the express train to change terminals and after getting off at our terminal, I finally got to eat those breakfast bagels that Harvey Spectre keeps munching on (Spoiler: They aren't that great).

From here we boarded our final flight to SEATTLE. It was a relatively quicker flight of 6 hours and 4 episodes of suits and 2 hours of sleep later, we finally arrived at the Seattle Tacoma airport. We got our bags and head to the cab pickup point. The moment we got out the aiport doors, the cold air hit and thats when we realised that it was COLD out here.

We uber'd to our hotel Hyatt at Olive 8 which was a really cool hotel that was close to the convention centre. The first thing I did after checking in was take a hot shower. After a 35 hour flight, I was dead tired but I had to power through and have dinner 
My colleague Anusha and I had dinner at Chans korean resturant where they had these AMAZING chicken wings:

![Chicken Wings](/assets/images/Chans.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}  

They also had this delicious roasted duck dish with rice and seaweed(Yep). So you had to roll the rice into a seaweed wrap and eat it which was very cool. 
After dinner I went back to my room and was just chilling around. I couldn't sleep for quite a while and ended up waking up groggy and jet lagged on day 2.


## Day 2 

This was a Sunday and the only day to really explore the city, so although I was jet lagged I wanted to power through .
Seattle has many touristy places like the seattle aquarium, the ferris wheel,etc but the uncontended number 1 was the Space needle.
We had bought a pass that allowed us a day and night entry into the Space Needle, so by 9pm we were at the space needle as planned.
The ground floor consisted of a mini mueseum which documented how the needle was built and a \**cough*\* overpriced \**cough*\* gift shop.
We made our way up to the space needle through an elevator whose operator does frontflips (no cap, he literally front flipped out the elevator doors giving us a jumpscare) to finally reach the top.

When we went up it was raining and it was C O L D out there. (*PS - Here's the taxanomy of how I'm going to refer to how cold it was. cold - meh | COLD - its kinda cold | C O L D - I can't feel certain parts of me anymore*)
The view was spectacular and we could see all of Seattle from up there. The rain however played a spoil sport and we couldn't get the best pictures but here's one in which I look presentable (*There is another taxanomy guide on how I refer to my own attire but I'll spare you from that*):

![Space Needle in the morning](/assets/images/Needle_Morning.jpg){: width="70%" .centered} 

After the space needle we went to the Seattle Aquarium and spent some time looking at the aquatic life in and around Seattle.
There was a cool Jelly fish arc reactor thingy, some octopus, cool fishes and some ugly spikey coral thingies that I poked for fun.

![Coral thingy](/assets/images/coral_touchy.PNG"){: width=40% .centered}  

The seattle aquarium works on the concept of tide simulation where all the aquariums inside have tidal systems that generate waves in the aquarium at regular intervals.
This is to give the fishes an accurate representation of how an actual sea would be and is known to help in keeping the aquariums cleaner.

After this we checked out of our temporary hotel and checked into The Westin Seattle where we stayed for the rest of the days. This hotel was super close to both the convention centre and the monorail station which made it really easy for us to commute. I also met a lot of other folks in The Westin who were also a part of the Aspire program (to the point where the lobby reception was filled with long lines of us microsofties) which was also very cool.

After checking into the hotel I just slept for a while. After a good dose on un-jetlagging myself, we decided to go back to the space needle to get the city view when its dark.
What we did not realise was that the nights here are not as long as they are in India right now. We reached there at around 7PM and found the sky to be BRIGHT as day. We then bing'd the sunset time - which was around 9PM. So we got ourselves some coffee and then waited for sunset. The space needle had a revolving glass floor, one level lower than the main level so we spent some time taking pictures then, until the sun finally set. And my god was it worth the wait - I'll let the pictures do the talking:

![Space Needle Evening](/assets/images/Needle_evening.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}

<br>

![Space Needle Night](/assets/images/Needle_Night.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}


We spent some more time taking pictures and then went down to the gift shop and bought some souvenirs before uber'ing home. We ended up eating our dinner in Westin itself before finally calling it a day and going to sleep

## Day 3

The day 3 is a mondayy and that means its time to get some work done. I had decided to allocate monday to Redmond day so that we can visit the "MICROSOFT HQ".
So we woke up early, got our bags packed and hopped onto SoundTransit545 aka the bus that goes to Redmond. We got off at the station close to the microsoft office and then got onto a giant walkway which took us straight into campus.
It was C O L D that day with temperatures around 10-11 C when we finally reached the campus. We walked around for a while and saw a huge football ground until we entered the commons.
The commons was the area where most of the employees would get their food. Since it was around 12PM by then, we decided to eat our lunch.
There was a cool concept of eating lunch by the pound, where you could take your pick of food choices and put them all in a bowl. At the end of this we could weigh the bowl and pay based on the weight of the food we chose. After eating our lunch, we went to Building 92 which seemed to be the main building. In there was a campus store, a gaming centre and the famous Microsoft Letters outside the building.
We spent some time at the Microsoft Store and looked around at a lot of cool stuff. There was a lot of Minecraft merch (Only for kids unfortunately) and I ended up buying a minecraft tshirt for my little brother, praying it fits him.
I also took a cool picture near the minecraft exhibits:
![Picture with Minecraft Background](/assets/images/Minecraft_bg.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}


After this, we explored the building even more and went outside to get our cliche picture with the Microsoft letters:

![Picture with the Microsoft Letters](/assets/images/MS%20letters.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}

After the pictures we went outside, strolling around the campus. We passed by Studio X and some cool fitness centre after which it started raining quite heavily. We then rushed back to building 92 to wait out the rain, but even after 15-20 mins the rain didn't seem to be stopping. So we decided to uber to Bellevue Square Mall which was close to us so we can spend some time looking around there. We stayed there for a while and I bought some stuff to take back to India. I ate some delicious "orange chicken" there at Panda Express as an early dinner.
After eating, we finally walked back to the bus station and took the 595 back to Seattle. The bus stop was 6 mins away from our hotel (thank god for that) so it was a quick walk back, after which we ended up crashing as we were super tired.

## Day 4

And now we're finally at day 3 aka ASPIRE DAY 1.
I got up early, showered and made myself a quick coffee before setting off to the Seattle Convention Centre to official kick off Start Strong Plus.
The Convention centre was a 6 minute walk from our hotel and the Aspire team had placeholders at the entrance to guide us to the event halls.

![Aspire Placeholder](/assets/images/Aspire_placeholder.jpg){: width="30%" .centered}


I made my way to the registration counter where they gave me my ID card. We were divided into 2 tracks, the deer and the orca.
The Deer track were for the Aspire MBA's and the Orca track were for the University hires.

![ID Card](/assets/images/ID_Card.jpg){: width="40%" .centered}

So I made my way to the hall for the Orca track where we kicked off Day 1 of Start Strong plus.
We started with a keynote fireside chat from Charlotte Yarkoni (President of Commerce and Ecosystem). She spoke about her Journey into Microsoft and how she really valued accountability and trust. Do what you say and say what you do was her motto. She talked about building accountability and trust as one of the the key values she believed in.
We then had an activity in which we were given pieces of paper with values, softwares and skills which we had to map to create the microsoft code of whats, whys and hows. We needed to map every "what" (software/product) to a "why" (value) and a "how" (skill) which was very insightful.

Next up we had a session on "Future Proofing". We had an activity lined up for this where we were given a scenario.

"Microsoft has ventured into the field of AI-based education and have put out an AI product which is supposed to replace teachers in the field of education.
However, this product is failing."

We were given 15 minutes to find all the possible reasons why this product could fail. We had a huge chartpaper on the table and multiple sticky notes and we had to brainstorm all possible problems that can occur and paste them on the chart.

Then, we were asked to grade them on a graph with the X axis being Probability of Occurence and Y axis being the Potential Impact.
The 3 major problems on the top right of the graph (with max probability and impact) were then chosen and wew had to come up with ways to mitigate the risks.

We came up with the major problems to be:
- Biased datasets while training which leads to the AI model not being inclusive.
- Infrastructural Issues while scaling the product.
- The lack of human interaction which is a requirement when teaching children

The rough solutions we had for these problems were to
- Ensure diversity in the team working on the AI model and sample the data properly so as to maintain inclusivity (Not a perfect solution, but a good place to start?)
- Ensure scale testing, and have Plans B,C,D incase of failure.
- No real solution to this, except using this product as a co-pilot to AID the teacher rather than BE the teacher.

We then had a lunch break where I found some of my college friends. We ended up taking a picture with the Aspire letters.

![Picture with Aspire Letters](/assets/images/Aspire_letters.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}  

*Fun Fact: We were all in the same section back in college*

After this we had a session on Unlocking Confidence from Gemma and Stew who were both distuinguished trainers for speaking skills.
For unlocking our confidence we had to do an activity, which was byfar the most interesting activity in the sessions.

We start by identifying our Gremlin.
Whats a Gremlin? They are our inner inner critics, the voice in our head which tells us we cannot do it everytime we think of something. 
We then have to name our Gremlin. Just give it a name of whatever you think off.
Then, we draw our Gremlin. Just a rough image of what your inner critic looks like in your head.

Now, write down the 3 things that your Gremlin tells you, when you're low. The worst things that your inner critic tells you.

This was the process of identifying your Gremlin. Now, we attack it!

Next, we have to write a counter statement for every thing that your Gremlin tells you.
Example:
If your Gremlin tells you that you're not good enough at work - you write a counter statement saying you're doing the best you can and improving everyday.

Then they gave us 10 mins to discuss our counterstatements with the people on the table

Now, we write the WORST thing your Gremlin tells you on a piece of paper. Write down your name, alias, Gremlins name and then hold the paper in the air.

Then at the count of 3 - we all crush this piece of paper and throw it across the room while yelling our Counter Statements.
After throwing our paper ball, we have to collect someone else's and check-in with them 2 months later on how they are doing with their inner critcism.

With this exercise we came to the end of the day.
I found this exercise to be really powerful as it teaches us a technique to not just deal with inner criticism but attack it.

If you really look at it, by the end of day one we connected with 8 random strangers from different countries, beliefs and values to the point of being vulnerable enough to share our harshest inner criticisms with them. If this does not show the One Microsoft spirit then I don't know what does.

## Day 5

I got ready for Start Strong Day 2 and made my way to the first session and boy was it a strong start.
We had a powerful fireside chat with our CFO Amy Hood and CCO Frank Shaw.
Frank was hosting the session by asking Amy a lot of questions from how she started her career to what are the major investments Microsoft is looking at.
Amy spoke about her career and how a lot of people expect their careers to be a linear path but more often than not - that is not the case.
She told us about how she was unemployed at the age of 30 after she left a job as a tour guide in a national park in Alcatraz.
The fact that she can go from being unemployed at 30 to being the CFO of one of largest companies of all time is really inspiring and shows you that one can achieve anything if they put their mind to it.
She also gave us Homework - which was to watch Satya's and Kevin's Keynotes at the recent Build event.
Here's the link to [Satya's Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OviTSFqucI).

After Amy and Frank's session, we had previous Aspirers come up on stage and answer questions on how their journey had been and how Aspire helped them to better position themselves for the future.

The next session was called Best Next Chapter and it included a fun activity.

First we start off with a paper having cups to represent our Growth, Relationships, Play and Wellbeing.
We gotta fill the cups to how content we feel with the above pillars.

Then we were asked to plan our near future (next 2 years) and write down our goals for them.
We were they told us to imagine that we had unlimited financial resources, calling this the status quo goals. 
Would your goals remain the same?
We had to write down these new goals in another paper.

From these goals, we were asked to pick a few achievable ones for each pillar and create a HOW to acheive every goal.
This should be a step by step outline to acheive the goal and must be time bound.

At the end of the session we were given a form to fill out about what we would want to tell our future self.
2 years later - we would get this form back to reflect upon

We then had a session on Elevating our Vocal Impact by Gemma and Stew.
This session involved us playing around with the modulations and the pitch of our voice.
It included us finding random partners and trying to speak to them while changing our pitch and modulations.
We also had an activity in which we were told to find a group of random people and make up a story with them using 3 random words.
Our words were Izaac, Orange and WaterBottle. After making up the story, we were told to improvise on the story by extending the time or cutting it short.
We were also asked to sing the story and enact the story as a mime.

After this session, we had our next Keynote Speaker, Cassandra Worthy.
She talked about the concept of Change Enthusiasm which is the excitement or eagerness that individuals or groups exhibit towards embracing and implementing change within an organization. It's a measure of how positively people respond to the prospect of change and their willingness to actively participate in it rather than resist it.
She gave us anecdotes from her life where she felt like she was unable to work with her manager or peers and taught us how to exhibit growth mindset and embrace change in our communities.

We (Ritika, Anusha and I) then rushed to our hotels to get changed up and ready to meet a Senior Leader and the Director of Defender Experts - Ryan Kivett.
I was a little nervous before meeting him. Not being much of a conversationalist myself, I was worried I would have nothing much to contribute to the conversation, but I was just overthinking it.
We met at a restaurant within the Westin (He was gracious enough to take time out and come meet us in Seattle) and once he came over we started talking about many different things.
We talked about our experience with Aspire so far and the different activities we had gone through, we asked him how he started off his career and he told us about his early days, different teams he worked on and different projects.
He told us stories about how the Defender Experts service began. We talked a lot about AI and how it has potential to enhance our service greatly. He gave me some great advice about higher education and whether its a nessecity for me to have a masters degree as I progress in my career in Microsoft.
We also talked about our hobbies where I told him about my unhealthy addiction to counterstrike and he told us how he loved fishing.

We didn't even realise that we spent nearly 3 hours talking. We took a nice picture by a fireplace nearby before we said goodbye to Ryan:

![Picture with Ryan](/assets/images/ryan_pic.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}  


Again, a big thank you to Ryan for taking the time out to come meet us and not getting annoyed by my 1000 emails while trying to schedule the meetup.
Also shout out to Abhi (my skip level manager) for connecting us with Ryan so we could have this meet-up. Networking with people is not my strongest suit so having managers who help in growing my professional connections is really amazing.

After he left, we went back to our rooms and crashed.

## Day 6

The final day of the Aspire Start Strong+ event. 
The sessions this day started at 10pm which gave us some backup time to sleep in.

The first session of the day was again with Stew and Gemma where they talked about the non-verbal communication.
They talked about the non-verbal flywheel which contained actions like smiling,using your hands, using your eyes etc
They then talked about active listening and enacted a scene in which they portrayed bad listening.
Then they told us some steps to practice good listening which consists of acknowledging someone else's speech through non-verbal cues, not interrupting, maintaining eye-contact and reiterating whatever the person said to show that you were intently listening.
We were then asked to find someone else and exhibit active listening skills while speaking to them.

The session started with a Fireside Chat with Joe Whittinghill, Priya Darshini and Chris Wells.
Chris hosted the chat and asked questions to both Joe and Priya about their journey. They each described how they started off thier careers.
Fun fact - Priya Darshini (Who is now a CVP and leads the Talent Management team) was an intern when she was hired at Microsoft.
It was really insightful listening to someone who had started from the grass root and made their way up to the top.

The next and penultimate session was an activity called CODE ME.
It was simple, you had 15 minutes to summarize all that we learnt and write a personal code for yourself.
We had to write the WHY WHAT and HOW of our existence (sounds dramatic but its not).
This code was our final takeaway from Aspire, something we can adapt into our day to day life to give us perspective and direction.

This brings us to the final session - the surprise guest.
A lot of people (me included) thought it would be Satya, however it was someone more magical.
The special guest was Oz Pearlman - a well known mentalist who has been on multiple TV shows and placed 3rd on America's got Talent.
We had an hour long session of our minds being blown with some crazy mentalism and mind reading tricks.

With this session, Aspire Start Strong + 2024 officially came to an end.
All that was left was the Social, later on that night at the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPoP).
We went up to Jason (Jazz) Gray and thanked him for such a great event and took a cool picture with him:

![Picture with Jazz](/assets/images/Jazz_pic.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}  

We went back to our rooms to change up for the Social night.
We got dressed and then caught the monorail and went straight to MoPoP.
The event was well organized with the whole mueseum being booked out for us.
There were all kinds of things from batman's original suit from the 90's to Ricky Gervais's guitar.
They had organized a DJ and a dance floor and given us some free drink coupons ans snacks.
We spent the rest of the night drinking and dancing, making memories I'll never forget.

## Day 7

This was byfar the coolest day of the trip, because we had planned to explore mount rainier today.
Oh also, Mandar an ex-microsoftie and one of my onboarding buddies was also in town so we convinced him to come on the hike with us.
So Karthik (My friend from college who was also attending Aspire), Anusha, Mandar and I had booked a Mt. Rainier tour on viator the day before and were ready in the morning to be picked up.

We got into the mini-van and were greeted by our tour guide Daniel with some snacks. He was a really chill guy and was great at his job. He drove us from Seattle towards Mount Rainier (Also called Tahoma) and told us stories about different places we saw on the way.

Our first stop was a view point from where we could get some good pictures of Mt Rainier.

![Viewpoint](/assets/images/Viewpoint.jpg){: width="40%" .centered}   

Our second stop was Christine falls. These were mini-waterfalls and not the coolest imo but we made a quick stop there and took some pics

![Christine Falls](/assets/images/Christine.jpg){: width="40%" .centered}  

We then stopped by at Narada Falls. Now this was a really cool waterfall. The stream was really powerful and we could see a rainbow forming at the base. These falls were extremely beautiful to look at and the water spraying on our faces was really relaxing.

![Narada Falls](/assets/images/Narada_falls.jpg){: width="40%" .centered}  

The coolest part about this waterfall was that we could see a rainbow forming at the base of the fall.

![Narada Falls with rainbow](/assets/images/Narada_rainbow.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}  

Then some more driving later, we finally reached the base of the snow capped Mt Rainier. Daniel had come equipped with snow walking sticks and given each of us one of them. So the four of us started our mini climb up the mountain. We climbed for a while, had a snowball (more like iceball) fight and struggled to remain standing. We took a lot of pictures, here are a few:

![Mt Rainier](/assets/images/Rainier.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}  

By the time we came back down from the mountain, everything was about to close. We quickly rushed to the visitor centre and got something to eat. I was super hungry and ate pizza slices like a maniac. At this point we(I) were pretty much exhausted and done with the trip. But Daniel had planned one last stop at a rainforest with super long trees.

![Long Trees](/assets/images/trees.jpg){: width="40%" .centered}  

We walked around the rainforest for a good 40 minutes before finally getting back into the minivan to go back home.
The ride back home was quite long and I just crashed for a good hour an a half. Once we reached the hotel lobby, we thanked Daniel and tipped him.
I just remember going back to my room and sleeping after that.

## Day 8

This was the last day at Seattle, I woke up early and went to Pike Market to buy some stuff. Then Anusha called me up and told me that Rangeet (Her skip level manager) and her teammate Ketan were also in Seattle. We went to go meet them near Kirkland where we went all shoppped for a while. We then went to the kirkland waterfront which was really beautiful. We ate some ice cream over there - before going back to Seattle for the Argosy harbour cruise. The four of us went on the one hour guided cruise which had a beautiful view of the skyline.

![Seattle Skyline](/assets/images/Seat_Skyline.jpg){: width="70%" .centered}  

It was quite late by the time we finished the cruise, so we uber'd back to our hotel and quickly ate some burgers before finally booking a cab to the airport.
We reached the airport well within time and had a lot of free time until we had to board our flight. Thats when I started writing this blog, I'm about 6 hours into the flight rn (The food was better this time) and hopefully the rest of the flight goes without incident :)


## Thank You's
I know this was wayyyyy longer than I intended this blog to be, but documenting life is good I guess.  
A special thank you to Suresh, Abhishek, Prasad, Shilpi, Ryan, Jason, the Aspire Team and everyone else involve in making this event happen for me.  
It was truly an experience I can never forget.   
If you've read till all the way down here - you are the real OGs.  
Thanks for reading!  
Stay safe and happy.  
Peace
