description: A quick project using chat gpt to create a trivia website from the scratch
---

This was a website I made during my summer vacation just to go learn the process of hosting a website from the scratch.  
Back in college, I worked on creating parts of a website but never actually created one from scratch. So while I was playing around with the GPT 3.5 API, I thought it would be cool to actually make a usuable website out of this.  
The UI in trivhive is bad and I will hopefully get around to fixing it up when I have time.  
I would absolutely love it if you could check it out [here](https://www.trivhive.com). (This may take some time to load T_T) 
Feel free to contact me for any bugs or ideas.
