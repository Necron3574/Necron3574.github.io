## Description  
### Convert hex to base64  
The string:
```49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d```  
Should produce:  
```SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t```  
So go ahead and make that happen. You'll need to use  this code for the rest of the exercises.

## Solution

- This is the first challenge of Set-1 and one of the most basic challenges. The task is to convert a hexadecimal string to a base64 encoded string.
- The main takeaway from this challenge ig is that the author wants us to make sure that the functions we create later should operate on raw bytes and some encoding should be used while displaying.
- We can use the b64encode function base64 module of python to solve this challenge.  
```python
import base64
def hex2b64(hexstring):
    return base64.b64encode(bytes.fromhex(hexstring)).decode()
```
- First we extract the raw bytes from the hexstring using the `bytes.fromhex()` function.
- Then, we can pass these raw bytes to the `b64encode()` function to get our result.

## Code  
```python
import base64

def hex2b64(hexstring):
    return base64.b64encode(bytes.fromhex(hexstring)).decode()

hexstring = "49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d"
output = hex2b64(hexstring)
assert output == "SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t"
print(output)
```
