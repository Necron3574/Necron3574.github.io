title: Set-1 Challenge-7

## Description  
### AES in ECB mode
The Base64-encoded content in this file has been encrypted via AES-128 in ECB mode under the key.  
`YELLOW SUBMARINE`  
(Case-sensitive, without the quotes; exactly 16 characters; I like "YELLOW SUBMARINE" because it's exactly 16 bytes long, and now you do too).  
Decrypt it. You know the key, after all.

## Solution

- In this challenge, we finally start working on modern ciphers that are used in real world applications. Our task is to decrypt an AES-128 encrypted ciphertext using the given key.
- We can use any crypto module to solve this challenge. Since I'm familiar with pycryptodome, I'll be using the AES class of that module to solve this challenge.
- The code is self explanatory, I get the data using the requests module and decrypt it using pycryptodome.

## Code  
```python
import base64
import requests
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

r = requests.get("https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/7.txt")
ciphertext = base64.b64decode(r.text)
key = b'YELLOW SUBMARINE'
cipher = AES.new(key,AES.MODE_ECB)
plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
print(plaintext.decode())
```
