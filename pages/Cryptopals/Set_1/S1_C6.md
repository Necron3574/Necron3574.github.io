## Description  
### Break repeating-key XOR  
It is officially on, now.  
This challenge isn't conceptually hard, but it involves actual error-prone coding. The other challenges in this set are there to bring you up to speed. This one is there to qualify you. If you can do this one, you're probably just fine up to Set 6.  
[There's a file here](https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/6.txt). It's been base64'd after being encrypted with repeating-key XOR.  
Decrypt it.  
Here's how:  
1. Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to (say) 40.  
2. Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance between two strings. The Hamming distance is just the number of differing bits.  
The distance between:  
`this is a test`  
and  
`wokka wokka!!!`  
is 37.  Make sure your code agrees before you proceed.
3. For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the second KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between them. Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.
4. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.
5. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.
6. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and so on.
7. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this.
8. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. Put them together and you have the key.  

This code is going to turn out to be surprisingly useful later on. Breaking repeating-key XOR ("Vigenere") statistically is obviously an academic exercise, a "Crypto 101" thing. But more people "know how" to break it than can actually break it, and a similar technique breaks something much more important.
## Solution
- This challenge is by far the toughest challenge in this set. Our task is to break a ciphertext encrypted with repeating-key xor (Vigenere) cipher without knowing the key.
- The approach to solving this problem has 3 steps:  
     1. Find the length of the key used.
     2. Group the bytes which have the same key length together.
     3. Solve the single character xor for these bytes.

- This challenge has some mathematical roots (read:[Kasiski Examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination)) which would be required to find the length of the key used. However, we have been given steps so we can follow those to get an approximate of the length of the key used. For this, firstly we need to write a function to find the hamming distance between two strings.
```python
def find_hamming_distance(a,b):
    c = bin(int(a.hex(),16)^int(b.hex(),16))[2:]
    return c.count("1")
```
- This function XOR's the 2 strings and counts the number of `1's` in the result. Since an XOR operation only results in a `1` when the bits differ, we can return this result as the Hamming distance.
- Thus, using the above function, we can write our final function to find the keysize of a given ciphertext.
```python
def find_vigenere_keysize(ciphertext):
    chosen_keysize = 0
    min_edit_distance = 100000000
    # As mentioned in the question, we find a keysize in between 2,40
    for keysize in range(2,40):
        # Since we want to normalize the edit distance,
        # We find the edit distance of every 2 combinations of consecutive KEYSIZE blocks and average them.
        # Ex - [(Block_1,Block_2)+(Block_2,Block_3)+...(Block_n-1,Block_n)] / n
        prev = None
        edit_distance = 0
        n = 1
        for i in range(0,len(ciphertext),keysize):
            if prev:
                edit_distance += find_hamming_distance(prev,ciphertext[i:i+keysize])/keysize
                # n = total number of blocks we averaged
                n += 1
            prev = ciphertext[i:i+keysize]
        # Dividing by total number of blocks for more normalization
        normalized_edit_distance = edit_distance/n
        # Storing the minimum edit distance
        if normalized_edit_distance < min_edit_distance:
            chosen_keysize = keysize
            min_edit_distance = normalized_edit_distance
    return chosen_keysize
```
- Thus, following the given steps and making some quick normalizations, we can get a fairly accurate guess on the key size for a Vigenere encrypted ciphertext.
- Now that we have the keysize, we can move on to the next part of the solution which is, transposing the ciphertext into blocks such that each byte corresponds to a specific key byte. One we do this, we reduce the problem from `breaking a repeating key xor cipher` to `breaking multiple single key xor ciphers.`  
###### Example -   
The plaintext `ABCDEFGHI` encrypted with the key `KEY` can be written as a combination of:  
`ADG` encrypted with `K`  
`BEH` encrypted with `E`  
`CFI` encrypted with `Y`

- Thus, after transposing these blocks, we can solve each single-byte-xor cipher to get our required transposed plaintexts.
```python
def break_vigenere(ciphertext):
    keysize = find_vigenere_keysize(ciphertext)
    decrypted_blocks = []
    for i in range(keysize):
        x = single_byte_xor_bruteforce(ciphertext[i::keysize])
        decrypted_blocks.append(x)
    # De-transposing the decrypted blocks to get final plaintext.
    final_plaintext = b''
    for i in range(math.ceil(len(ciphertext)/keysize)):
        for block in decrypted_blocks:
          # I was lazy to think of a clean way to avoid out of bounds error so I just used try catch lol
            try:
                final_plaintext += bytes([block[i]])
            except:
                pass
    return final_plaintext
```
- However, remember that the plaintext blocks are still transposed so we need to put them back together to get our final plaintext.
- Thus, with this we can essentially break any English plainext encrypted with vigenere cipher. We can extend this to any language provided we have enough data on that language to perform the frequency anaylsis accurately for the single byte xor part. The rest of the steps remain the same.
