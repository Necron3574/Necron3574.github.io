title: Cryptopals - Set 1
description: Solutions to Set 1 of the Cryptopals challenges
---

This is the beginner set or the "Qualifying" set as they call it.  
The challenges on the set consist of a few basic concepts and test your coding skills.  
The Sixth challenge was especially challenging as it needed a decent amount of scripting proficiency.  
I struggled on this set for weeks when I first started off, but this time it took me about 2.5 hours to finish it so yayy.  
### Challenges
1. [Convert hex to base64](S1_C1.md)
2. [Fixed XOR](S1_C2.md)
3. [Single-byte XOR cipher](S1_C3.md)
4. [Detect single-character XOR](S1_C4.md)
5. [Implement repeating-key XOR](S1_C5.md)
6. [Break repeating-key XOR](S1_C6.md)
7. [AES in ECB mode](S1_C7.md)
8. [Detect AES in ECB mode](S1_C8.md)
