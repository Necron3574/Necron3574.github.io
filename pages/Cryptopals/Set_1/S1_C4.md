### Detect single-character XOR
One of the 60-character strings in [this file](https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/4.txt) has been encrypted by single-character XOR.  
Find it.
## Solution
- This is an extension to the previous challenge where we were asked to design a function that breaks a single byte xor'd ciphertext.
- In this challenge, we are given a list of ciphertexts out of which one is encrypted with a single byte. Our task is to find this encrypted ciphertext and decrypt it.
- First, we can start by parsing the data given into a list of ciphertexts (I used the requests module to get the data but this can be done in many ways).
```python  
r = request.get("https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/4.txt")
ciphertext_list = r.text.splitlines()
```  
- Our approach to this challenge builds on what we did in the last challenge. We will first decrypt all given ciphertexts and store their best-scored plaintexts in a list using the scoring algorithm we created in the last challenge. Now, since we know that only one of the plaintexts is going to be legit, we'll run the same scoring algorithm on the newly acquired list of plaintexts.
```python
plaintext_list = []
for ciphertext in ciphertext_list:
    plaintext_list.append(single_byte_xor_bruteforce(bytes.fromhex(ciphertext)))
print(max_freqency_score(plaintext_list).decode().strip())
```
- Thus, the maximum scored plaintext of the list of plaintexts will be the required plaintext.
