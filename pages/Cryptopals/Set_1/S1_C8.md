### Detect AES in ECB mode

In [this file](https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/8.txt) are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.  
One of them has been encrypted with ECB.  
Detect it.  
Remember that the problem with ECB is that it is stateless and deterministic; the same 16 byte plaintext block will always produce the same 16 byte ciphertext.
## Solution

- In this challenge, we are given a bunch of ciphertexts and we are asked to detect which one of them has been encrypted with AES-ECB.
- AES in Electronice Code Book (ECB) mode is a deterministic encryption technique. This means that every 16 byte plaintext block will encrypt to the same 16 byte ciphertext block everytime its encrypted as long as the key remains the same.
- We can exploit this property to detect whether a ciphertext is encrypted via AES_ECB.
- Our approach to solving this is to check if any block (16 bytes of data) of ciphertext occurs more than once.
```python
def detect_ecb(ciphertexts):
    ecb_detected_ciphertexts = []
    for ciphertext in ciphertexts:
        ciphertext = bytes.fromhex(ciphertext)
        for i in range(0,len(ciphertext),16):
            for j in range(0,len(ciphertext),16):
                if i==j:
                    continue
                if ciphertext[i:i+16] == ciphertext[j:j+16]:
                    ecb_detected_ciphertexts.append(ciphertext)
                    break
    return ecb_detected_ciphertexts
```
- If a block occurs more than once, then we can deduce that the plaintext blocks are the same aswell and that it is encrypted using AES-ECB. Thus, we can add all such blocks to a list and return that list.

## Code
```python
import requests
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

def detect_ecb(ciphertexts):
    ecb_detected_ciphertexts = []
    for ciphertext in ciphertexts:
        ciphertext = bytes.fromhex(ciphertext)
        for i in range(0,len(ciphertext),16):
            for j in range(0,len(ciphertext),16):
                if i==j:
                    continue
                if ciphertext[i:i+16] == ciphertext[j:j+16]:
                    ecb_detected_ciphertexts.append(ciphertext)
                    break
    return ecb_detected_ciphertexts

r = requests.get("https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/8.txt")
ciphertexts = r.text.splitlines()
ecb_detected_ciphertexts = detect_ecb(ciphertexts)
print("The ECB encrypted ciphertexts are :")
for ciphertext in set(ecb_detected_ciphertexts):
    print(ciphertext.hex())

```
