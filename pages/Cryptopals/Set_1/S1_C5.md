### Implement repeating-key XOR
Here is the opening stanza of an important work of the English language:
```
Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
```
Encrypt it, under the key `ICE`, using repeating-key XOR.
In repeating-key XOR, you'll sequentially apply each byte of the key; the first byte of plaintext will be XOR'd against `I`, the next `C`, the next `E`, then `I` again for the 4th byte, and so on.

It should come out to:
```
0b3637272a2b2e63622c2e69692a23693a2a3c6324202d623d63343c2a26226324272765272

```
## Solution
- In this challenge, we are asked to implement a repeating-key xor cipher. This is a very famous cipher called the `Vigen√®re cipher`. It had been used in the second world war by British spies and was believed to be unbreakable for many centuries.
- The essential idea in this cipher is that the key repeats itself over and keeps XOR'ing its bytes with the plaintext bytes, like shown below:

```
Plaintext   = thisisaplaintextmessage
Key (hello) = hellohellohellohellohel
```

- Thus, we need to XOR each plaintext byte to the key byte which corresponds to the index of the plaintext byte modulo length of key.
- In simple words this means that, we need to ensure that the key wraps around if the plaintext exceeds its length.

```python
def repeated_key_xor(plaintext,key):
    ciphertext = b''
    for i,j in enumerate(plaintext):
        ciphertext += bytes([j^key[i%len(key)]])
    return ciphertext
```

- And again, as per our convention, we work on raw bytes inside the functions.

## Code  

```python
import base64

def repeated_key_xor(plaintext,key):
    ciphertext = b''
    for i,j in enumerate(plaintext):
        ciphertext += bytes([j^key[i%len(key)]])
    return ciphertext

plaintext =
"""Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal""".encode()
key = b'ICE'
ciphertext = repeated_key_xor(plaintext,key).hex()
assert ciphertext == "0b3637272a2b2e63622c2e69692a23693a2a3c6324202d623d63343c2a26226324272765272a282b2f20430a652e2c652a3124333a653e2b2027630c692b20283165286326302e27282f"
print(ciphertext)

```
