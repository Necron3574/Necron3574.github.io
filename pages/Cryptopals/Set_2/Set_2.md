description: Solutions to Set 2 of the Cryptopals challenges
---

This was the set where I had left off last time.  
This set was interesting as a few challenges had concepts that help in breaking actual real world crypto.  

### Challenges
1. [Implement PKCS#7 padding](S2_C1.md)
2. [Implement CBC mode](S2_C2.md)
3. [An ECB/CBC detection oracle](S2_C3.md)
4. [Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)](S2_C4.md)
5. Coming soon ...
