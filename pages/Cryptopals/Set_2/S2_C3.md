### An ECB/CBC detection oracle
Now that you have ECB and CBC working:

Write a function to generate a random AES key; that's just 16 random bytes.

Write a function that encrypts data under an unknown key --- that is, a function that generates a random key and encrypts under it.

The function should look like:

```
encryption_oracle(your-input)
=> [MEANINGLESS JIBBER JABBER]
```

Under the hood, have the function append 5-10 bytes (count chosen randomly) before the plaintext and 5-10 bytes after the plaintext.

Now, have the function choose to encrypt under ECB 1/2 the time, and under CBC the other half (just use random IVs each time for CBC). Use rand(2) to decide which to use.

Detect the block cipher mode the function is using each time. You should end up with a piece of code that, pointed at a block box that might be encrypting ECB or CBC, tells you which one is happening.

## Solution

- This challenge has 2 parts. The first part of the challenge asks us to create a random oracle that encrypts data using ECB or CBC randomly. The second part is to generate a detection function that will detect the encryption mode used given the plaintext.

Part 1:  
- We can follow the steps told by them to generate a random oracle. Firstly we know it uses a random key every time it encrypts. Then, it adds about 5-10 (This is also randomly chosen) bytes of data before and after the plaintext and encrypts it. It randomly encrypts the text in ECB and CBC. When using CBC, it generates a randomly generated IV.
- Thus, using the random and os module of python, we can generate such an oracle.

```python
def encryption_oracle(plaintext):
    key = os.urandom(16)
    prefix = os.urandom(random.randint(5,10))
    suffix = os.urandom(random.randint(5,10))
    plaintext = prefix + plaintext + suffix
    if(random.randint(0,1)):
        print("Encryption Mode used = ECB")
        return ecb_encrypt(plaintext,key)
    else:
        print("Encryption Mode used = CBC")
        iv = os.urandom(16)
        return cbc_encrypt(plaintext,key,iv)
```

Part 2  
- Now, to generate the detection function. Looking at the encryption oracle, it looks like almost everything is randomized and feels really hard to exploit. However our task is to just detect the mode.
- So lets first analyze what we have and what we need, we have the ability to give the oracle any plaintext we like and get its ciphertext. Now we need to figure out how to use this ciphertext to detect the mode.
- We know that any plaintext encrypted in ECB mode will always produce the same ciphertext. However, in CBC mode this is not true. Hence we found our exploit.
- We need to make the oracle encrypt 2 blocks of the same plaintext. If these block result in the same ciphertext then we can say that the mode detected is ECB. If NOT then we can say the mode is CBC.
- Now, how do we pass a message that is 2 blocks long with the random bytes added before and after? So we have:

```
RandomPrefix Plaintext RandomSuffix
```

- The length of RandomPrefix and RandomSuffix vary from 5-10 bytes. So, to avoid any randomness, we can have our message be long enough to make sure the 2nd and the 3rd blocks remain the same. So we need to pass a message which has a length of x (for covering the remaining bytes in the first block) + 32 (For the 2 plaintext blocks).
- Thus, lets assume the worst case that the random suffix is 5 bytes. In this case, the plaintext should have a length of (16-5) + 32 = 43 bytes. This is so that the first 11 bytes cover the remaining space in the first block and the next 32 bytes ensure that the next 2 blocks have the same plaintext.
- So our payload can be `b"a" x 43` because this will ensure that the plaintext blocks 2 and 3 will always remain the same for any random prefix and suffix between 5-10.
- Thus we can send this payload to the oracle with our detector function to get the ciphertext.

```python
def detect_mode():
    plaintext = b"A" * (11+16+16)
    ciphertext = encryption_oracle(plaintext)
    if ciphertext[16:32] == ciphertext[32:48]:
        print("Encryption detected  = ECB")
    else:
        print("Encryption detected  = CBC")
    print()
    return
```
- Now that we have the ciphertext, all we need to do is check the 2nd and 3rd blocks. If they are the same, we can conclude that the mode used is ECB else the mode used is CBC.
