### Implement CBC mode

CBC mode is a block cipher mode that allows us to encrypt irregularly-sized messages, despite the fact that a block cipher natively only transforms individual blocks.

In CBC mode, each ciphertext block is added to the next plaintext block before the next call to the cipher core.

The first plaintext block, which has no associated previous ciphertext block, is added to a "fake 0th ciphertext block" called the initialization vector, or IV.

Implement CBC mode by hand by taking the ECB function you wrote earlier, making it encrypt instead of decrypt (verify this by decrypting whatever you encrypt to test), and using your XOR function from the previous exercise to combine them.

The file here is intelligible (somewhat) when CBC decrypted against "YELLOW SUBMARINE" with an IV of all ASCII 0 (b"\x00\x00\x00...")


## Solution

- In this challenge, our task is to use our previous knowledge to write a function that will encrypt data using AES in its CBC mode.  
- CBC or Cipher Block Chaining mode, as the name suggests, is a mode in which the plaintext is `"chained"` or `"XOR'd"` with its corresponding previous ciphertext.  
- Because of this chaining, each plaintext block will no longer produce the same ciphertext block as opposed to its ECB counterpart. Since each block is XOR'd with its previous ciphertext, there is more diffusion in the ciphertext and there is very little leakage in data (You won't see the penguin anymore).
- Since the first plaintext block does not have a corresponding previous ciphertext block to be XOR'd with, it uses what's called an Initialization Vector (IV). This IV need not be secret, however it needs to be unique and unpredictable. Ideally, an IV must be generated for every encryption randomly and must be transmitted with the ciphertext. Re-usage of the same initialization vector leads to attacks which will probably be shown in later challenges.
- So now, lets start coding the encryption and decryption function. We can use the ECB encryption function we used before. We just need to account for the padding and the chaining parts of this mode. For that, we will just run a loop which XOR's every plaintext with its previous ciphertext and after the XOR, we use the ECB encrypt function to encrypt the plaintext block and add it to the ciphertext.

```python
def cbc_encrypt(plaintext,key,iv):
    plaintext = pad(plaintext,16)
    ciphertext = b''
    for i in range(0,len(plaintext),16):
        block = plaintext[i:i+16]
        if i==0:
            pre_encrypted_block = fixed_xor(block,iv)
            ciphertext += ecb_encrypt(pre_encrypted_block,key)
        else:
            pre_encrypted_block = fixed_xor(block,ciphertext[i-16:i])
            ciphertext += ecb_encrypt(pre_encrypted_block,key)
    return ciphertext
```

- We also add a condition for `i==0` so that the plaintext gets XOR'd with the IV. Alternatively we can just let the first block of the ciphertext be the IV and just run the loop so that we'd get the result as `iv+ciphertext`.

- Now, for the decryption algorithm we do the same thing in reverse.
- We iterate through every block of the ciphertext and decrypt it using ECB first. Then we XOR it with the previous ciphertext to get the plaintext as the result. For the first block, we XOR it with the IV to get the first plaintext block.

```python
def cbc_decrypt(ciphertext,key,iv):
    plaintext = b""
    for i in range(0,len(ciphertext),16):
        block = ciphertext[i:i+16]
        decrypted_block = ecb_decrypt(block,key)
        if i==0:
            plaintext += fixed_xor(decrypted_block,iv)
        else:
            plaintext += fixed_xor(decrypted_block,ciphertext[i-16:i])
    return pkcs7_unpad(plaintext)
```

- A fun fact to note is, CBC encryption is not parallelizable however CBC decryption can be parallelized and can run on multiple cores. This is because, every step of CBC encryption depends on the information you get in the previous step. However in the decryption phase, you already have all the information required.

## Code

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import requests
import base64

def fixed_xor(a,b):
    if len(a)!=len(b):
        return "Unequal Lengths"
    c = b''
    for i,j in zip(a,b):
        c += bytes([i^j])
    return c

def pkcs7_pad(data,pad_len=16):
    pad_num = pad_len - len(data)%pad_len
    data += bytes([pad_num])*pad_num
    return data

def pkcs7_unpad(data,pad_len=16):
    pad_num = int(data[-1])
    return data[:-pad_num]

def ecb_encrypt(plaintext,key):
    cipher = AES.new(key,AES.MODE_ECB)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
    return ciphertext

def ecb_decrypt(ciphertext,key):
    cipher = AES.new(key,AES.MODE_ECB)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
    return plaintext

def cbc_encrypt(plaintext,key,iv):
    plaintext = pad(plaintext,16)
    ciphertext = b''
    for i in range(0,len(plaintext),16):
        block = plaintext[i:i+16]
        if i==0:
            pre_encrypted_block = fixed_xor(block,iv)
            ciphertext += ecb_encrypt(pre_encrypted_block,key)
        else:
            pre_encrypted_block = fixed_xor(block,ciphertext[i-16:i])
            ciphertext += ecb_encrypt(pre_encrypted_block,key)
    return ciphertext

def cbc_decrypt(ciphertext,key,iv):
    plaintext = b""
    for i in range(0,len(ciphertext),16):
        block = ciphertext[i:i+16]
        decrypted_block = ecb_decrypt(block,key)
        if i==0:
            plaintext += fixed_xor(decrypted_block,iv)
        else:
            plaintext += fixed_xor(decrypted_block,ciphertext[i-16:i])
    return pkcs7_unpad(plaintext)

r = requests.get("https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/10.txt")
ciphertext = base64.b64decode(r.text)

iv = b'\x00' * 16
key = b'YELLOW SUBMARINE'

plaintext = cbc_decrypt(ciphertext,key,iv)
print(plaintext.decode())
```
