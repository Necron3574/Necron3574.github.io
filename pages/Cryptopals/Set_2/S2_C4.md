### Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)
Copy your oracle function to a new function that encrypts buffers under ECB mode using a consistent but unknown key (for instance, assign a single random key, once, to a global variable).

Now take that same function and have it append to the plaintext, BEFORE ENCRYPTING, the following string:

```
Um9sbGluJyBpbiBteSA1LjAKV2l0aCBteSByYWctdG9wIGRvd24gc28gbXkg
aGFpciBjYW4gYmxvdwpUaGUgZ2lybGllcyBvbiBzdGFuZGJ5IHdhdmluZyBq
dXN0IHRvIHNheSBoaQpEaWQgeW91IHN0b3A/IE5vLCBJIGp1c3QgZHJvdmUg
YnkK
```
Spoiler alert.
Do not decode this string now. Don't do it.

Base64 decode the string before appending it. Do not base64 decode the string by hand; make your code do it. The point is that you don't know its contents.

What you have now is a function that produces:

`AES-128-ECB(your-string || unknown-string, random-key)`  
It turns out: you can decrypt "unknown-string" with repeated calls to the oracle function!

Here's roughly how:

1. Feed identical bytes of your-string to the function 1 at a time --- start with 1 byte ("A"), then "AA", then "AAA" and so on. Discover the block size of the cipher. You know it, but do this step anyway.  
2. Detect that the function is using ECB. You already know, but do this step anyways.
Knowing the block size, craft an input block that is exactly 1 byte short (for instance, if the block size is 8 bytes, make "AAAAAAA"). Think about what the oracle function is going to put in that last byte position.  
3. Make a dictionary of every possible last byte by feeding different strings to the oracle; for instance, "AAAAAAAA", "AAAAAAAB", "AAAAAAAC", remembering the first block of each invocation.  
4. Match the output of the one-byte-short input to one of the entries in your dictionary. You've now discovered the first byte of unknown-string.  
5. Repeat for the next byte.  

## Solution

- This challenge is where "things get real" because this is a the first challenge which breaks modern real-world cryptography.  
- We have access to an oracle that encrypts every plaintext we send to it with a randomly generated KEY using AES in the ECB mode. The oracle behaves such that, it appends our plaintext with some secret data before encrypting it. It then returns the ciphertext to us such that `ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext + secretdata)`.  

```python
# Vulnerable Encryption Function
def encryption_function(plaintext):
    suffix_string = """Um9sbGluJyBpbiBteSA1LjAKV2l0aCBteSByYWctdG9wIGRvd24gc28gbXkgaGFpciBjYW4gYmxvdwpUaGUgZ2lybGllcyBvbiBzdGFuZGJ5IHdhdmluZyBqdXN0IHRvIHNheSBoaQpEaWQgeW91IHN0b3A/IE5vLCBJIGp1c3QgZHJvdmUgYnkK"""
    plaintext = plaintext + base64.b64decode(suffix_string)
    return ecb_encrypt(plaintext,KEY)
```

- Our task is to use this oracle to recover the secret data without having any knowledge of the key.  
- Firstly, lets begin by computing the length of the secret data. We already know that the oracle uses AES-ECB so we can assume the blocksize to be 16 (However, we can test to find this aswell). Now that we know the blocksize, we just need to send random data of length varying uptill the blocksize to see if there is any jump in the length on ciphertext.
- When the jump happens, we know that the data wraps over the blocksize at that point and thus we can conclude that the length of the data is `BLOCKSIZE - length of data sent`

```python
def find_data_length():
    length_1 = len(encryption_function(b'X'))
    for i in range(16):
        length_2 = len(encryption_function(b'X'*i))
        if length_2 != length_1:
            return length_1 - i
```

- Now, that we know the length of the data, we can start extracting bytes one by one. To do that, we follow the logic mentioned above in the challenge description.
- To recover the first byte, we send in a block of 15 "A"s. Thus, what the oracle encrypts in its first block will be 15 As and 1 byte of secret data. We will save this ciphertext block as our target.
- Now, we will send in 256 different payloads to the oracle to try every possible byte. These payloads will be such that they have 15 "A"s and 1 variable byte that goes from 0-255.
- We will the first block of every ciphertext we receive to our target block. Since we know that any plaintext encrypted in ECB mode will always produce the same ciphertext, if the 2 ciphertext blocks match, the byte we used in the payload would match with the byte of the secret data.
- Thus, we can recover one byte of data. Similarly, for the second byte we can pass 14 "A"s and the recovered_byte as the target data and 14 "A"s + recovered_byte + variable byte as our payload and so on.    
- Since we already found the length of the secret data, we can loop this function to recover the secret data completely.
