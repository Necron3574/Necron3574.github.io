title: Cryptopals
description: A collection of my solutions to the Cryptopals Challenge
---
Cryptopals was where I first started writing crypto related code. I'd learn the theory from the youtube lectures of [Christof Paar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg) (which I highly recommend) and then try to implement them through cryptopals.
When I started off, I was in my sophomore year and I had no prior coding experience so I struggled to solve the challenges and as far as I can remember, I could barely get to the second set.  
Now, that I have some time on my hand, I thought it would be a fun exercise to try this again.  
I'll keep updating my solutions over here (very unregularly) so check them out xD.

### Sets
- [Set 1](Set_1/Set_1.md)
- [Set 2](Set_2/Set_2.md)
- More solutions coming soon ...
