#### Hello! I'm Kaustubh (Necron3574)

For a long time now, I've been thinking of starting a blog/website where I could post stuff I found cool. Now that I have some time, I thought I should finally give this a try.

#### A lil about me  
I’m a final year undergrad student in Manipal Institute of Technology, majoring in Computers and Communication Engineering.  

I have been working (Both as an intern and as a part-time consultant) with [SecureThings](https://securethings.ai/) for about an year now, where I’ve learnt a lot about the applications of cybersecurity in the Automotive industry.  

I’m also a Board Member and the Cryptography Subsystem Head of my team [Cryptonite](https://cryptonite.team/), which is the official ethical hacking team of my college.  

I have an affinity towards cybersecurity and cryptography, and the majority of my work revolves around these topics.
The stuff I do ranges from Capture the Flag competitions with my team to random computer-science related projects which I'll (hopefully) be putting up here.

This website, is the consequence of a boring summer vacation so I'm not sure how often I'll be updating/bloggin here xD.   
However, I'd love your feedback so please feel free to [reach out](pages/contact_me) to me incase you find any bugs on the site or just wanna have a good ol' chat.
