##### Hello! I'm Necron.  

For a long time now, I've been thinking of starting a blog/website where I could post stuff I found cool. So, now that I have some time, I thought I should finally give it a try.

##### A lil about me  
I'm a final year undergrad student in Manipal Institute of Technology, majoring in Computers and Communication Engineering.  
I have been working (Both as an intern and as a part-time consultant) with [SecureThings](https://securethings.ai/) for about an year now, where I've learnt a lot about the applications cybersecurity in the Automotive industry.  
I'm also a board member and Cryptography Subsystem head of my team [Cryptonite](https://cryptonite.team/), which is a student project based off on ethical hacking.  
I have a keen interest for Cybersecurity and Cryptography and implementing them in IOT-Devices.  
The stuff I do ranges from Capture the Flag competitions with my team to random comp-science related projects which I think would be fun.
Feel free to reach out to me if you ever wanna have a chat.
